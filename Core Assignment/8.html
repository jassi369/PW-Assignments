      <dt>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</dt>
      <dd>
        HTML is the standard markup language used to structure and present
        content on the World Wide Web. It provides a set of elements (tags) that
        define the structure of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs,
        images, links, and more. HTML acts as the backbone of a webpage,
        organizing the content in a hierarchical manner.
      </dd>
      <dt>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</dt>
      <dd>
        CSS is a style sheet language used to control the presentation and
        layout of HTML elements on a web page. It enables developers to define
        styles, such as colors, fonts, margins, padding, and positioning, which
        dictate how the HTML elements should appear to users. CSS helps separate
        the content from the presentation, making it easier to update and
        maintain the visual aspects of a website.

      <dt>JavaScript</dt>
      <dd>
        JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily
        used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. It
        allows developers to manipulate HTML and CSS, handle user interactions,
        perform calculations, and fetch data from servers without requiring a
        page reload. JavaScript is essential for building modern web
        applications and creating a seamless user experience.

      <dt>MongoDB</dt>
      <dd>
        MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like
        format called BSON (Binary JSON). It is designed to handle large amounts
        of unstructured or semi-structured data, making it well-suited for
        scalable and agile applications.
      </dd>
      <dt>Express.js</dt>
      <dd>
        Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies
        the process of building server-side applications. It provides a robust
        set of features for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and
        integrating with databases like MongoDB.
      </dd>
      <dt>React.js</dt>
      <dd>
        React.js is a popular front-end JavaScript library for building user
        interfaces (UI). It allows developers to create reusable UI components
        that efficiently update and render when data changes. React's virtual
        DOM minimizes direct manipulation of the actual DOM, resulting in faster
        and more efficient user interfaces.
      </dd>
      <dt>Node.js</dt>
      <dd>
        Node.js is a server-side runtime environment built on Chrome's V8
        JavaScript engine. It enables developers to run JavaScript on the
        server, making it possible to create full-stack applications with a
        unified language. Node.js provides non-blocking, event-driven I/O
        capabilities, making it highly efficient and scalable.
