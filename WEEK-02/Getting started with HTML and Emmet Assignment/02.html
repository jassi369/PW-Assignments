    <h1>Comments</h1>
    <p>
      HTML comments are non-executable lines of code added within the markup to
      provide helpful notes, explanations, or reminders for developers. They
      play a crucial role in making code more readable and maintainable, as they
      are ignored by web browsers and have no impact on the appearance or
      functionality of a web page. Comments in HTML are denoted by the
      <!-- opening tag and the -->
      closing tag. Developers often use these comments to describe the purpose
      of specific sections, clarify complex code, or temporarily disable certain
      elements during debugging. By using HTML comments effectively, web
      developers can enhance collaboration, documentation, and the overall
      efficiency of the development process.
