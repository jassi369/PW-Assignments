Question: Write a short note on tage, elements, and attributes along with examples.

Answer: Tags: In HTML tags are used to define elements that are used to represent
         paragraph, list, images etc. We use (<>) to define tags. They have opening 
         closing tags. for example <div></div>
        Elements: Elements are used to represent text, paragraph, image, link etc 
        They are the most basic component of the html document. Example <p>hey</p> 
        this as a whole is an element.
        Attributes: They are used to provide additional properties or adjustments 
        or information to the HTML elements. Their syntax is like <p class="class">hey</p>
        Class is an attribute.
