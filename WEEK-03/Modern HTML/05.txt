5. Write a short note on the tab index.
    The tabindex attribute in html specifies the order in which elements are focusable,
    and the order in which they are navigated with the tab key. The tabindex attribute
    can be used on any element that can be focused, such as buttons, input fields, and 
    links. It accepts an integer value which decides which element is focusable.
    for example 
    <input type="text" tabindex = "1">
    <button tabindex="2">submit</button>
    now when the user presses the tab button first it will focus on input and then on button
