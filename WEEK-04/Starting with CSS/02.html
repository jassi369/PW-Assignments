      CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language
      used to control the presentation and layout of HTML and XML documents. It
      is a fundamental part of modern web development and is essential for
      creating visually appealing and consistent web pages across different
      devices and screen sizes. CSS works by defining rules that specify how
      HTML elements should be displayed on a web page.
