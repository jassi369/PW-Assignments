          The Real Leadership Lessons of Steve Jobs

          Six months after Job's death, the author of his best selling biography
          identifies the practices that every CEO can try to emulate

            writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents' garage in
            1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy
            in 1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into
            the world's most valuable company. Along the way he helped to
            transform seven industries: personal computing, animated movies,
            music, phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital
            publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of America's great
            innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney.
            None of these men was a saint, but long after their personalities
            are forgotten, history will remember how they applied imagination to
            technology and business.
